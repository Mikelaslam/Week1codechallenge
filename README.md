# Project Tittle: Week 1 Code Challenge

******

## Project Description

In this Code Challenge I am going to work on 3 code challenges. The Student Grade Generator, Speed detector, and Net Salary Calculator. By applying the knowledge acquired from the coursework so far, we are going to write programs to satisfy the expectations given in each case.

******

## _Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator_

We are going to write a program that prompts the user to input the student marks. The input should be between zero(0) and one hundred(100) and the correct grade should be output as:
Grade A > 79
Grade B > 60 to 79
Grade C > 59 to 49
Grade D > 40 to 49
Grade E > less 40

## _Challenge 2: Speed Detector_

In this case we will come up with a program which takes as input the speed of a car for example 80. If the case is such that the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". If the case is not as stated above, it should award the driver one penalty point and print the total number of demerit points.

## _Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator_

Assuming we are given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, we have to write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
A link is provided where we can get and use the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values in this challenge.

## Project Setup

After creating the repository on your Github account, we go ahead and create either a folder containing all the three files or separately creating each javascript file for each challenge. 
We will go ahead and create the programs in the grader.js, speed_detector.js, and net_salary.js respectively.
